# Web Scraper

## Overview

This is an App developed as part of a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp class.  This App was designed to show my comprehension of MongoDB, Mongoose, and Cheerio.

## How to Use

The homepage doesn't have any scraped articles so the 'Scrape Articles' button must be pressed.  This will scrape articles from the New York Times Science section.  From there an article can be saved and then retrieved by clicking 'Saved Articles'. Notes can be added to specific saved articles by clicking 'Article Note'.  This will take you to the notes section for that article where notes are added.  Any previous notes will be displayed with the option of deleting them by pressing the red button with an 'X'.  An article can also be deleted by pressing the 'Delete Article' button when in 'Saved Articles'.  **Clicking 'Home' or 'Scraped Articles' at the top of the page will removed any previous scraped articles and do another scrape of the New York Times site.
